13. **Those that would like to help clean up the west, please PM me or the r/HuskersRisk Mods!!** *You will be assigned a offensive or defensive target on a first come, first served basis as long as there are slots available. Once all positions are filled, I will notify those that haven't been assigned and they should use their birthday to select their target. Please include your star count in the PM*

**If all available slots for the territory you are assigned are filled \(there are only grey cells left\) then please pick from any of the other options above that still have slots available.**

Do not defend or attack any other territories unless you receive a PM from us to do so! We will be forming special squads via PM to help defend certain territories in the west, but DO NOT defend any western territories without a PM to do so. **DO NOT ATTACK OR DEFEND UCLA AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE BIGGER FISH TO FRY**

If you have questions about the strategy, please reach out to the mods, as we are attempting to transition to a PM based system. **The full strategy will also be published on r/HuskersRisk at 10:00 PM CST tonight for everyone to see**

**DO NOT ATTACK OUR ALLIES: STANFORD, ALABAMA, OKLAHOMA, TEXAS A&M, OHIO STATE, WISCONSIN, OR VIRGINIA TECH UNLESS IT IS IN THE ORDERS. DOING SO WILL SUBJECT YOU TO REMOVAL FROM THE SUB**.

**[UPDATE THE SPREADSHEET HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8C3pOrd2tS2Gw33awoRN8Lk2-wxUxEnKNmOx9pJpHI/edit?usp=sharing)** with your move or have somebody else do it for you **by 5 p.m. CT** so that we may re\-balance our attacks/defenses as well as provide valuable statistics to our allies so they may do the same. It's really vital for tracking and managing a 1000\+ person army.
