**State of the Union:**

I'm not sure what else to say. South Carolina continues to exist, despite our best attempts to eradicate them. RNG must have a hard on for them against us because the managed to lose what should have been a sure win against OU and upset us in BYU. According to our numbers folks over at Stanford, the Gamecocks should have had, at best, a 24% chance of victory in BYU. Today we are throwing the kitchen sink at the problem using a new formula that was cooked up using estimated multipliers and previous actions of the opponent to pick optimal moves against them. We will make adjustments or get rid of it, depending on how it performs tonight.

NOTE: Stanford has agreed to mobilize and will be sending a force cross country to Illinois to fight. Today they will be heading to Iowa, kicking out Wisconsin on their way east. **DO NOT ATTACK MINNESOTA!! Please and thank you.**

**GOALS**: KILL THE GAMECOCKS

13. **Those that would like to help clean up the west, please PM me or the r/HuskersRisk Mods!!** *You will be assigned a offensive or defensive target on a first come, first served basis as long as there are slots available. Once all positions are filled, I will notify those that haven't been assigned and they should use their birthday to select their target. Please include your star count in the PM*


**If all available slots for the territory you are assigned are filled \(there are only grey cells left\) then please pick from any of the other options above that still have slots available.**

Do not defend or attack any other territories unless you receive a PM from us to do so! We will be forming special squads via PM to help defend certain territories in the west, but DO NOT defend any western territories without a PM to do so. **DO NOT ATTACK OR DEFEND UCLA AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE BIGGER FISH TO FRY**

If you have questions about the strategy, please reach out to the mods, as we are attempting to transition to a PM based system. **The full strategy will also be published on r/HuskersRisk at 10:00 PM CST tonight for everyone to see**

**DO NOT ATTACK OUR ALLIES: STANFORD, ALABAMA, OKLAHOMA, TEXAS A&M, OHIO STATE, OR WISCONSIN. AT ALL. DOING SO WILL SUBJECT YOU TO REMOVAL FROM THIS SUB**. We know attacking Wisconsin is tempting, but they have a part to play in our strategy for destroying the blue team.

**[UPDATE THE SPREADSHEET HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8C3pOrd2tS2Gw33awoRN8Lk2-wxUxEnKNmOx9pJpHI/edit?usp=sharing)** with your move or have somebody else do it for you **by 5 p.m. CT** so that we may re\-balance our attacks/defenses as well as provide valuable statistics to our allies so they may do the same. It's really vital for tracking and managing a 1000\+ person army.

As always, the mods' door is open, we are reading your comments, listening to your suggestions, and are happy to share in this experience with all of our fellow Huskers. Please remember to keep discussions and disagreements friendly and avoid ad\-hominem or personal attacks.


Additionally, if you are not interested in receiving this PMs, please reply letting us know and your name will be removed. Please be patient as processing is done manually.

Thanks,

Team HuskersRisk
