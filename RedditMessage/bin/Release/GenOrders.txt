*PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT DEFEND OR ATTACK ANY TERRITORY THAT WE DID NOT LIST ABOVE!* **THIS INCLUDES UCLA!!!**

**UNLESS IN THE ORDERS, DO NOT ATTACK STANFORD, ALABAMA, TEXAS A&M \(aggies\), WISCONSIN, OKLAHOMA, OR OHIO STATE HELD TERRITORIES WHATSOEVER. THEY ARE OUR ALLIES.** We know you guys don't like Wisconsin, but their being our ally is beneficial to taking out the blue team and they have, whether you know it or not, been very helpful so far. Also, please double check to make sure you've clicked the right territory and are performing the correct action. We have too many people defending land\-locked territories or attacking/defending the wrong ones because of apparent misclicks. If you need to know what school is what, use the old Google machine to lookup the team's logo.

Friendly reminder to not make any alternate accounts/bot accounts. Users who are found doing so will have their alt/bot accounts as well as their main account reported to the mods of [/r/CFBRisk](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBRisk). Also, do not karma farm, that is bad juju and Scott Frost disapproves.

May Frost be with you; may RNGesus smile upon us; and, as always, Go Big Red!
